## Introduction :
YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing is a project aimed at developing a user-friendly Streamlit application that leverages the power of the Google API to extract valuable information from YouTube channels. The extracted data is then stored in a MongoDB database, subsequently migrated to a SQL data warehouse, and made accessible for analysis and exploration within the Streamlit app.
